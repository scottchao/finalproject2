						<h3>Who We Are</h3>
						<p>Career Ch!na, an innovative project initiated by a group of Stanford students, aims to bridge the gap between Chinese enterprises and Chinese students studying in the US who are interested in pursuing a career back home. We are inviting industry leaders from China to our well-organized Career Fair at Stanford University in spring of 2013. This great opportunity is open to all students in the US, though we have a focus on Chinese students from universities in California.</p>
						</p>

						<h3>What We Do</h3>
						<p>To help China-based enterprises or local companies with plans to expand China market reach the prospective talent in top US universities. We devote ourselves to providing our clients with a unique, effective, and rapid alternative to traditional overseas talent sourcing. Conventionally recruiters post their positions on internet sites, then wait for the right candidate happens to find the job listing and to apply. We attempt to replace this ineffective and reactive recruiting precess with our proactive solutions through building direct connection between our client companies and the potential candidates, marketing your brand to enthusiastic and bilingual fresh graduates with cross-cultural background and right skill set. For more detailed introduction of our clients' benefits, please see our <a href="./strengths.html">strengths.</a></p>
						<p>To help Chinese students at Stanford and other great universities in California seek better career opportunities back in China. According to our survey, there are 75.86% Chinese students from established universities in California are interested in going back to China for job opportunities after graduation. At present students look for job opportunities in China either by personal connections or through general job search sites; however, various factors including remote communication, inadequate information, time difference, drive our students to be searching for a more effective way in their job hunting, no matter how talented and qualified they are. Therefore we aim to offer a platform where our students can actively meet, communicate with, and impress their future employers from China in a short period of time.</p>

						<h3>How We Do</h3>
						<p>Career Ch!na is designed to hold a Western style career fair this year on the Stanford campus where, by our invitation, the first class companies from China will market their brand overseas, have face-to-face communication with promising students from all majors, and recruit future employees with right skills. The flow of Career Ch!na Career Fair 2013 is as below:</p>
						<h4>Marketing and Publicity</h4>
						<p>We implement a  well-designed marketing strategic plan, and our career fair publicity covers the entire Stanford Chinese student community, including undergrads, master's, PhDs, and research scholars. As our partner, Stanford's Career Development Center (CDC) will post all our activities on its official, high-traffic website open to Stanford students. We also receive strong support from our partner schools in California, which ensures Chinese students in those schools are kept updated on our Career Fair.</p>
						<p>In addition, we reach out experienced Chinese employees who have been working in Silicon Valley for a number of years and who are interested in work opportunities back in China</p>
